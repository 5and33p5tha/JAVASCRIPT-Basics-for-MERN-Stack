   <title>JS : Switch Cases (Number As An Input Value)</title>
</head>

<body>

   <pre>
        Switch Cases:-


        Instead of multiple if-else statements, the switch case makes such operations much easier
    </pre>


   <script>





      document.write(`Example 1:-`)
      let a = Number(prompt(`Enter a Number`))
      switch (a) {
         case 1:
            document.write(`Today is Sunday`)
            break


         //If break is not used, the statements after this are also executed
         //that is even if the desired output is displayed, the cases after that are also displayed


         case 2:
            document.write(`Today is Monday`)
            break


         case 3:
            document.write(`Today is Tuesday`)
            break


         case 4:
            document.write(`Today is Wednesday`)
            break


         case 5:
            document.write(`Today is Thursday`)
            break


         case 6:
            document.write(`Today is Friday`)
            break


         case 7:
            document.write(`Today is Saturday`)
            break


         default:
