        Java Script is a scripting or programming language for the web. It however does not Multi-Task Like Java, as it is a single threaded language. Hence it is synchronous in nature. At A Time, Only One Value is Passed, Similar to C Programming.
        The JS is a Programming Language for Web Pages and has a Top to Bottom approach

    </pre>

    <script>
      let a = prompt("Enter The Value Of a");

      // The PROMPT ASKS THE USER THE INPUT VALUE

      console.log(a);
      // This Passes the value of a in console in INSPECT of Web Page So We Can Find The Error Easily. ERROR CHECKING BASICALLY

      document.write(a);
      // This Allows us to PRINT THE INPUT VALUE i.e IT SHOWS OUTPUT, THIS OVERWRITES THE PREVIOUS VALUES IF PUT IN ACTION FOR EXAMPLE PUT IN ACTION OF BUTTON AS CLICK

      window.alert(a);
      // This Shows a POP UP MESSAGE of what we entered

      window.print(a);
      // This PRINTS the document LITERALLY!

      // DEMO EXPLAINATION
      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "HELLO";
      // here, as the div demo is in previous flow, the word hello is printed first rather than other programs
