   <title>JS : Switch Cases (String As An Input Value)</title>
</head>

<body>

   <pre>
        Switch Cases:-


        Instead of multiple if-else statements, the switch case makes such operations much easier

      document.write(`Example 1:-`)
      let a = (prompt(`Enter a Number`))
      switch (a) {
         case 'sun':
            document.write(`Today is Sunday`)
            break


         //If break is not used, the statements after this are also executed
         //that is even if the desired output is displayed, the cases after that are also displayed


         case 'mon':
            document.write(`Today is Monday`)
